# Supervision 2.0 - PRD & Project Memory

## Product Overview
Supervision 2.0 is a web-based compliance evidence platform for UK adult social care providers. Users record supervision meetings, and the system automatically generates transcripts, summaries, CQC compliance mappings, and Care Certificate competency evidence.

**Product Name:** Supervision
**Live URL:** https://1two.one

## Architecture
- **Frontend:** React (JavaScript), Tailwind CSS, Shadcn UI, Lucide React icons
- **Backend:** FastAPI (Python), PostgreSQL (Supabase) via asyncpg, native DB-level RLS
- **AI:** Direct OpenAI SDK (`o4-mini` reasoning_effort=high for analysis; `gpt-4o` for speaker mapping/diarisation/PII/prep)
- **Transcription:** AssemblyAI EU endpoint only (Dublin) — strict data governance, no Whisper
- **Email:** Resend (hardcoded `noreply@notify.1two.one`)
- **Storage:** Supabase Storage for audio + supervision docs; Emergent Object Storage for org logos only
- **Auth:** JWT (Bearer token in localStorage), Email OTP 2FA

## Core Features Implemented

### Auth & Security
- [x] JWT authentication with role-based access control
- [x] Email OTP 2FA — mandatory for super_admin, optional for admin/manager
- [x] Brute force protection, is_active check on every request
- [x] Password policy (10+ chars, upper, lower, number, special)
- [x] Force password change for super_admin-created users

### Multi-Tenancy / Super Admin
- [x] `super_admin` role — single fixed account seeded from env vars
- [x] Organisations collection with status (active/suspended)
- [x] Data isolation via org_id + PostgreSQL RLS (session-variable, `with_org()`)
- [x] Super Admin dashboard: org grid, user panel, create org/user modals
- [x] Invite admin flow: branded email via Resend, 72-hour token, AcceptInvite page

### Organisation Structure (Sub-Tenant RBAC)
- [x] Settings (branches) and Teams hierarchy
- [x] Drag-and-drop org structure page
- [x] Scoped managers see only their branch/team staff and meetings
- [x] Schedule write guards — 403 for out-of-scope staff

### Meeting Lifecycle
- [x] New Meeting: single-step form, auto-generated title, browser local time, Meeting type first field, title preview + Create button at top
- [x] Recording: MediaRecorder API, pause/resume, notice logging
- [x] Post-meeting processing: AssemblyAI EU transcription → o4-mini analysis (background async)
- [x] Review workflow: attendee mark-reviewed, manager sign-off
- [x] Re-open flow: two-party consent (request + approve)
- [x] Audio deleted after 5-min grace period post sign-off (GDPR)

### AI Analysis (utils/ai.py)
- [x] **Strengthened evidence framework** — o4-mini now maps described practice, explained reasoning, confirmed observations, and identified learning needs. No longer requires explicit regulation citation.
- [x] Care Certificate: maps to most specific sub-outcome ref; practice narration = strongest evidence
- [x] `reasoning_effort="high"` for analysis and doc evidence
- [x] CQC + Care Certificate + custom/org standards in single pass
- [x] PII scan: full transcript (no truncation), regex + GPT-4o, chunked at 40K chars

### Transcript & Review
- [x] Speaker diarisation (AssemblyAI) + name mapping (GPT-4o)
- [x] Speaker View / Full Text toggle; per-turn reassignment; split turn
- [x] Find & Replace (single + all), Ctrl+H shortcut
- [x] Manual anonymisation (highlight → first initial)
- [x] PII review gate (first open only)
- [x] Inline transcript editing

### Evidence & Compliance
- [x] CQC Inspection Prep page (per-regulation coverage bars, gaps)
- [x] Care Certificate Prep page
- [x] "View in transcript" from evidence cards (fuzzy quote matching)
- [x] Staff Portfolio (evidence by standard, meeting history, PDF export)
- [x] Team Intelligence matrix (CC drill-down modal, date-range filter)
- [x] Evidence export CSV/PDF

### Dynamic Supervision Prep
- [x] Focus Topics (org-level, with active_month locking)
- [x] Focus Topic locked/read-only in Meeting Prep when active month topic exists
- [x] Context sources: previous meetings, uploaded docs, org standards
- [x] AI question generation (GPT-4o, background)
- [x] Prep coverage check post-analysis; carry-forward missed questions as actions
- [x] Prep Agenda tab on Meeting Report (read-only for supervisees)

### Document Import
- [x] Upload previous supervision doc (PDF/DOCX) → async o4-mini evidence scan
- [x] DocUploadReport page; portfolio "Imported Documents" section
- [x] Doc scoped to specific org_id + staff member

### Scheduling
- [x] Recurring schedule templates per staff member
- [x] Supervision Matrix page (colour-coded grid: red/amber/green)
- [x] Due schedule cards on Dashboard with "Start" button
- [x] Custom weeks frequency (weeks_N format)

### Other
- [x] PDF export (signed-off meetings, optional transcript)
- [x] Email report to attendees (Resend)
- [x] Actions rollover (outstanding from previous meetings)
- [x] Org branding (logo + brand colour)
- [x] Custom supervision template (org-wide steps checklist)

## Prioritized Backlog

### P1
- None outstanding

### P2 (Upcoming)
- Role-specific competency framework upload (admin uploads per-role competency doc; AI maps evidence against it)
- Skills for Care Effective Supervision Guide — per-org upload option

### P2 (Future)
- Pending invites dashboard
- Usage dashboard (meeting counts, last activity, storage per org)
- Billing hooks (Stripe — tie orgs to plan/subscription)
- Impersonate org feature for Super Admins
- Meeting duplicate / template feature
- Bulk export of evidence reports
